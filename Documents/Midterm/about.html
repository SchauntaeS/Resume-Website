        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>
            I am a dedicated college student pursuing a degree in
            computer programming while working full time. My journey in
            programming began in high school, igniting a passion for technology
            and problem-solving that continues to flourish.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to academic and professional commitments, I volunteer with
            NeighborWorks Great Falls, contributing to community efforts by helping
            to build homes alongside 10 Homeowners. This hands-on experience has
            deepened my appreciation for craftsmanship and community service.
            <br>
            <br>
            Looking ahead, I plan to start building my own house in the spring
            of 2025, blending my love for programming with practical skills
            learned through volunteering.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of school and work, I enjoy a peaceful life surrounded by
            beloved cat, dog, and boyfriend of three years. As an outdoor
            enthusiast, I love hiking, swimming, and camping. In quieter moments
            you can find me immersed in movies and books or lending a helping
            hand to friends.
            <br>
            <br>
            With a strong sense of community and a commitment to personal growth,
            I hope to embody the spirit of balancing ambition with a love for the
            simple joys of life.
